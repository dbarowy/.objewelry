Now that you have an STL file, you are nearly ready to 3D print a ring!
Your next step will be to visit the Makerspace at Williams College (makerspace@williams.edu).
You can either transfer the STL file onto a flash drive or bring your computer to the Makerspace.
While you are working with the lovely people at the Makerspace, be sure to specify that you would like to print a (COLOR) ring.

Good luck and thanks for using our language!
